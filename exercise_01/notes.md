# Notes for Exercise 1

- [x] Basic training loop works now
- [x] Performance need to be evaluated
- [ ] Batching with dataloader
- [ ] Better model architecture
- [ ] Callbacks:
    - [x] Best model
    - [ ] LR Scheduler
    - [ ] Early stopping

## Run the training
within `exercise_01`:
```bash
uv run python run_training.py # or
python run_training.py
```
## Exercises
- [x] Download the data
- [x] Visualize a few spectra
- [ ] Implement a standard CNN to predict the three labels
- [ ] Visualize and document the performance


### Plots
Plots for spectra are run by running `load_data` as the main script
