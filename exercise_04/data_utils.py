def collate_fn_gnn(batch):
    """
    Custom function that defines how batches are formed.

    For a more complicated dataset with variable length per event and Graph Neural Networks,
    we need to define a custom collate function which is passed to the DataLoader.
    The default collate function in PyTorch Geometric is not suitable for this case.

    This function takes the awk arrays, converts them to PyTorch tensors,
    and then creates a PyTorch Geometric Data object for each event in the batch.

    !!!You do not need to change this function.!!!

    Parameters
    ----------
    batch : list
        A list of dictionaries containing the data and labels for each graph.
        The data is available in the "data" key and the labels are in the "xpos" and "ypos" keys.
    Returns
    -------
    packed_data : Batch
        A batch of graph data objects.
    labels : torch.Tensor
        A tensor containing the labels for each graph.
